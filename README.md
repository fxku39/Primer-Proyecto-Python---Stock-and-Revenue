# First-Project-Python---Stock-and-Revenue

## Python project for retrieving Stock data and Revenue from any Ticker

#### Objectives
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, we will extract some stock data and then display this data in a graph.

#### Summary of results
In this guided project we used new libraries like yfinance and BeautifulSoup to extract stock data from different sources so we can do an analysis of the market and evaluate the historic data and Revenue for certain company shares. We learn how to apply and work with python coding with HTML to do the web scraping for extra data and learn how to plot graphs with matplotlib. We created our own code to do the web scraping and use of yfinance library and surpass some difficulties along the way with research on our own and the documentation of each library.
